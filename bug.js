```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text with a gradient background.</p>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for background gradients. However, if the `to-purple-500` class is not correctly included or interpreted, it might render the background as only `from-blue-500` or not at all.  This is a common problem when transitioning between colors or utilizing gradient features in Tailwind, and often is due to typos, version mismatch or issues with the config file.
