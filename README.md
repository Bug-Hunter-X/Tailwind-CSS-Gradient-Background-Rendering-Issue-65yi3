# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds where the gradient doesn't render correctly, often showing only one of the specified colors. The bug.js file contains the problematic code, while bugSolution.js provides a solution. 

## Bug Description

The issue arises when using the `bg-gradient-to-*` utility classes in combination with color classes such as `from-*` and `to-*`.  Sometimes only one color will display.
